Step 1 
**Structure my React app using client side routing** 
Create AppRouter so that I am able to navigate between pages without going whole page refresh - Done

Step 2
Create new files for the components - Done 
Setup imports, component, default export - Done
Import into AppRouter so they can be used - Done
Create a separate component for Header - Done
Make editTrip link dynamic - Done

Step 3
** Start using Redux with React **  
Notes: Connect the components to the redux store so they can
read off of the store so they can fetch values from the store
and render those.
