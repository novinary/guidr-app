Front End for Guidr App

Guidr is an app that helps backcountry guides of all types log their private/professional trips.

## **Web Application Development Role Description**

React JS has been my focus over the last 4 weeks. I will use those skills learned during the React Unit to build out a web application that consumes a CRUD API.

## **The `Web Application Development` unit explored the following topics:**

- Functional Components 1 - 2
- Class Components 1-2
- React Tooling
- The React Life-cycle
- React Composition Patterns
- CSS in JS
- React Router 1 - 2
- HTTP/AJAX 1 - 2
- Redux Fundamentals 1 - 2
- Async Redux w/ Redux Thunk

For my project this week, I will demonstrate proficiency by working with a group of students cross section to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) over the course of the week.

## **My primary role as the Web Application Architect:**

I will use my skills to be responsible for the Front End Architecture of this project. I will work directly with the UI Developer and the Back End Developer to ensure that all React components are wired up in proper fashion.

I will use this rubric to help guide my development processes
